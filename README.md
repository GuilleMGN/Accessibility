# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This assignment is to make an existing webpage more accessible, and to refactor the code to make it more organized and put it in logical order. 
What I did to make this code better was using semantic elements which meant replacing some of the <div> to a more meaning and appropriate element that would make sense to take its place. Also changed around any classes that I thought would be more appropriate as class, and any classes that I think would be better as ID's - looking at it from the perspective of whether or not it would be used multiple times, or potentially used again in the future. To better understand the coding, I rearranged and commented on both the CSS and HTML files to determine what part of the coding changed a part of the website. Also to try to make the website more accessible, I changed the font size to be slightly larger to reduce the amount of blank space for each section. 

Some challenges I faced while doing the homework was figuring out what exactly needed to be done at the start, and what specifically had to be changed, but with the help of my peers during a zoom call session and during office hours I was able to figure out and verify what was asked of me. 

Overall, I managed to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, differences between class and id, and applications for semantic elements. 
The images are called within the code and are located on the Accessibility folder to prevent breaking.
